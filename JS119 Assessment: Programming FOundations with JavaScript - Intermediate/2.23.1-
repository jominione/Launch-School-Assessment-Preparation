// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWord = 'Hello';
myWord.concat(' there.');

console.log(myWord);

// Solution:

// Will output `Hello`. On line 4 the program initialises a global
// variable `myWord` with string value `'Hello'`.

// On line 5 myWord is caller of string method `concat` with string `' there.'`
// passed as an argument which returns `Hello there.`. Nothing is outputted
// to console.

// Because `myWord` points to primitive value and primitives are immutable
// calling the `concat` method on `myWord` does not change the value of `myWord`.

// Since the value of `myWord` has not changed on line 7 when `console` is 
// called with argument `myWord` it outputs `Hello`.
