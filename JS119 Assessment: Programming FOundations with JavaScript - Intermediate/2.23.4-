// What will the following code log to the console and why? Don't run it until 
// you have tried to answer.

let myWords = ['Hello'];
myWords.concat(['Goodbye']);

console.log(myWords);

// Solution: Will output `['Hello']`.

// On line 4 global variable `myWords` is declared and initialised with array
// `['Hello']`.

// On line 5, array method `concat` is called by `myWords` and passed argument
// the array `['Goodbye']`. `concat` returns a new array with argument appended 
// to end of caller array. `myWords` is unaffected.

// Hence on line 7 when `console.log` is invoked with argument passed value
// of `myWords` the output is `['Hello']`.
